# Unsupervised-ML
Unsupervised machine learning on anime dataset

This repository includes:
_ A notebook to contain the EDA of the dataset, 2 ML clustering based on user and animes, and 2 recommendation systems: content based and user based.
_ A report that summarizes the findings and details of our approach.
_ Raw data from MyAnimeList

The anime industry is no doubt a rapidly growing and profitable business. The reason why anime is getting more attention is because it encourages diverse viewpoints and gives a perfect medium for the creators and audience opportunities to share their thoughts across different cultures. However, navigating among the large number of genres of anime make it confusing for new anime viewers to select their favorites between the expansive collections of anime available. It also makes it harder for producers to target different types of viewers and to provide the best products content for their fandom.

This project used unsupervised machine learning in an attempt to group the animes and users into several groups with different characteristics by using K-means and Hierarchical clusterings. Two recommendation systems were built: Content-based and collaborative filtering. Content-based recommendation is frequently used in the first phase of the recommending products to consumers, with NLP analysis on tags or sypnopsis of the products using cosine similarity metric. Collaborative filtering is frequenly used after some data collection from the consumers to use similar users' preferences to make suggestion using Jaccard distance and Knn algorithm.
